To set up a Gradle project, add a dependency, and run a single file, follow these steps:

Install Gradle (if not already installed):
If you don't have Gradle installed on your system, you can download and install it from the official Gradle website: Gradle Installation Guide.

Create a New Gradle Project:
You can either create a new Gradle project using the gradle init command or manually create the project structure. For simplicity, we'll use the gradle init command:

bash
Copy code



mkdir MyGradleProject
cd MyGradleProject
gradle init --type java-application


gradle build  


grale run
